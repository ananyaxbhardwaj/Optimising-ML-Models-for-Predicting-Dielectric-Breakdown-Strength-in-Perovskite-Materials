ABSTRACT OF THE RESEARCH WORK
Advanced energy materials have emerged as a hot area of research today, as the demand for global energy and the immediate requirement for sustainable materials is growing. Of all these materials, the perovskite structure has attracted much attention lately given its unique optoelectronic and dielectric properties. Herein, this paper proposes to discuss the characterization of machine learning approaches toward predicting the perovskite material's dielectric breakdown strength (Fb). It is crucial to characterize the stability of materials with high electrical stress in energy storage and electronic applications. We use the ML framework of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection by training and evaluating six ML models, namely Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and Bagging-with metrics including R², RMSE, and MAE. The dataset is supposed to be a total dataset including 209 perovskite samples with electronic and structural properties such as dielectric breakdown strength (Fb), phonon cutoff frequency (ωmax), lattice constants, band gap, and crystallographic space groups. Among them, XGBoost performed at its best model with an R² of 0.792 and an RMSE of 0.613, indicating stronger accuracy and stability. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting worked reasonably well.
In contrast, AdaBoost and LightGBM presented with lower predictive accuracies. This work opens avenues for future ML-driven material discovery by shining light on the potential of ensemble models for accurate property prediction in perovskites. Future directions for this work include greatly enhanced expansion of the dataset, application of state-of-the-art feature engineering techniques, and the development of accessible predictive tools to prototype high-performance materials for use in sustainable energy applications rapidly.
